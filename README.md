- 👋 Hi, I’m @wickywaa
- 👀 I’m interested in building cool robots and even cooler frontends to interact with them
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, computer vision, raspberry pi, webRTC , APIs, 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with robotics, drones, webrtc and raspberry PI

I'm pretty good with React and node.js but I am still picking up python , I learned it a few years ago aon a codeacademy course so now I have to use it in practise, 
If you have some skills with computer vision and machine learnign  I can help out with the frontend!
